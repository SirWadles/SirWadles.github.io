                <h1> I am Adrian Hernandez</h1>
                <p>I am currently a Junior at Vista Murrieta High School. I am hoping to be able to enter UCLA or UCSD as they are good schools for getting a major in Computer Science. I am able to program in the language Python and currently learning how to program in JavaScript. I can also write in HTML, an example being this website. </p>

                <p>I am aspiring to be a software engineer or a game developer as they are some of the things I would find fun to do. I understand that they are not easy jobs, but somethign that I still would like to do. That is the reason as to why I chose UCLA or UCSD as the Universities that I want to attend in the futuree as they are some of the best schools to go to for a major in Computer Science</p>
